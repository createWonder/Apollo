Description: 

Apollo is interactive virtual reality (VR) world that is being developed using the Unity game engine. The project comprises of C# scripts and related extended reality (XR) tools.The project's deployment and testing is targeted for the Oculus Quest 2. 

The world relates to the mythical Greek god Apollo and has no relation to the spacecrafts! 
The world instead focuses on Apollo’s traits, namely truth, light, archery, music, and poetry. They will be depicted as regions with unique characteristics but still having a unified theme. World visitors will start from the courtyard. The courtyard is center point where all the regions join. There will be pavements leading to the regions to guide visitors.

 World regions:
 
(1) Archery: In this region a visitor can practice hunting or explore the scenery, apart from archery. 

(2) Truth: This region will be dim, ghoulish, and filled with mystery. This dark and trees that line the path to truth are dead leafless trees.   

(4) Light: Still working on this region!!

(5) Music and Poetry:  It will be whimsical world with music and the harp. 

⚠️ Apollo is  underdevelopment and is subject to change. ⚠️
